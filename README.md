# File Handling with Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption

This project involves file handling operations combined with Caesar cipher encryption and decryption techniques in C programming language.

## Overview

This program provides functionalities for various file handling operations such as creating, reading, writing, appending, updating, renaming, and deleting files. Additionally, it incorporates Caesar cipher encryption and decryption methods to ensure data security while storing or retrieving information from files.

## Features

- **File Operations:** Perform file handling operations including:
  - Creating new files.
  - Reading data from existing files.
  - Writing or appending data to files.
  - Updating file contents.
  - Renaming files.
  - Deleting files.
- **Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption:** Implement Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithms to encode and decode data within files.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling to manage scenarios where files do not exist, or operations fail due to various reasons.

## Usage

1. **Compilation:** Compile the source code using a C compiler.
   ```
   gcc main.c -o file_handling_caesar_cipher
   ```
2. **Execution:** Run the compiled executable to perform file operations with Caesar cipher encryption/decryption.
   ```
   ./file_handling_caesar_cipher
   ```
3. **Instructions:** Follow the prompts provided by the program to perform specific file operations and encryption/decryption tasks.
